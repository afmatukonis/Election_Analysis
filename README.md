# Election_Analysis
Module 3

**Overview of Election Audit**

The purpose of this project is to find out the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. During Module 3 we learned how to read csv files into Python and run the data as well as using for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators we were able to find the election results. 

**Election Audit Results**

This specific data set had four columns that we had to search through. One column was the candidates and we used that to figure out how many votes each candidate recieved. After figuring out the total votes and the percentage of the total we then wrote the resutls to a text tile.

+ How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

In this election there were 369,711 votes cast.

+ Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

Jefferson had 38,855 total votes, 10.5%

Denver had 306,055 total votes, 82.8%

Arapahoe had 24,801 total votes, 6.7%

+ Which county had the largest number of votes?

Denver had the largest number of votes with 306,055

+ Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 votes, 23.0% 

Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes, 73.8%

Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes, 3.1%

+ Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 total votes and their percentage of the total votes was 73.8%

**Election-Audit Summary**

Using this script we are able to effectively find vote counts and percentages as well as votes won by each candidate and their corresponding percentages. Ideally we could also add another if statement to figure out what percentage of each county voted for each candidate under line 76. Also we could use populations and add them into the csv file and then compare total votes in each county to total population of each county to figure out exactly what percentage of people are actually voting. 

**Issues with code**

I was unable to get the candiate winner to populate in the winner column even though I was able to get the county winner to populate.
